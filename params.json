{"name":"Ffpopsim","tagline":"FFPopSim is a collection of C++ classes and a Python interface for efficient simulation of large populations, in particular when the product of mutation rate and population size is larger than one. It consists of one library for individual-based simulations, and a complementary one for simulation of the entire genotype distribution. The latter is coded efficiently using Fast-Fourier Transforms to speed up recombination operations.

It allows for asexual and recombining populations and complex fitness functions, including pairwise and higher order epistasis. It is designed to study the effects of linked selection, the rare processes in large populations, and can be used to address a large variety of population genetics problems.\r\n\r\nFFPopSim is easy to use via the Python interface and can be extended or modified both at the C++ or Python level.\r\n\r\nThe official sources for FFPopSim are online at:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/neherlab/ffpopsim\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/iosonofabio/ffpopsim\r\n\r\nDocumentation and examples are online at:\r\n\r\nhttp://webdav.tuebingen.mpg.de/ffpopsim/\r\n\r\nTo install the library, read the INSTALL file.\r\nThe two configuration files are:\r\n\r\n- Makefile\r\n- setup.py (for the Python extension)\r\n\r\nEnjoy.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
