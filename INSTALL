DEPENDENCIES
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Make is used to build the FFPopSim library. FFPopSim depends on:
- the GNU Scientific Library (http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/)
- BOOST (http://www.boost.org/)

The python wrapper requires:
- Distutils (http://docs.python.org/library/distutils.html)
- NumPy, SciPy, and MatPlotLib (http://www.scipy.org)

The C++ documentation, in case you want to rebuild it, requires:
- Doxygen (http://www.doxygen.org/)

The Python documentation, in case you want to rebuild it, requires:
- Sphinx (http://sphinx.pocoo.org/)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALL
-------------------------------------------------------------------
For the impatient ones, call

make

and have a look in the pkg folder.

Full instructions
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Please open the Makefile and have a look at the first few lines.
Please set the required variables in the Makefile according to your
platform (C/C++ compiler, Python interpreter, etc.) and preferences
(optimization level).

You can build the various pieces separately:

1. To build only the C++ sources, call

make src

2. To build also the Python bindings, call

make python

3. To build the documentation, call

make doc

4. To build the C++ test programs, call

make tests

To build all of them, just call

make

The C++ library and the Python module files are stored in the pkg
folder. Copy them into your system folders (e.g., /usr/local/lib and
/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages) to make them available to all
users.

Documentation and examples
-------------------------------------------------------------------
C++ and Python examples are available in the tests and examples
folders. They are commented, so you should be able to understand
what it's being done there by reading the code directly.

The documentation for the C++ library can be found in pkg/doc/cpp.
The documentation for the Python bindings are in pkg/doc/python.
