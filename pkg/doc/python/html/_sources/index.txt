   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to FFPopSim

   Contents

In addition, the underlying C++ library is documented `here <../../cpp/html/index.html>`_. Note that some objects and functions have slightly different names in C++ and Python.

Examples
---------------------
Usage examples of FFPopSim can be found at the following pages.

The descriptions focus on FFPopSim and tend to ignore aesthetic aspects of the scripts
such as figures, labels, *et similia*. This also means that glueing together the various
code chunks found at those pages will not produce exactly the same figures; neither is this
necessary at all, because the full source code for all examples (and more) can be found in the
`examples <../../../../examples>`_ folder.

.. note:: examples are ordered by increasing complexity.
